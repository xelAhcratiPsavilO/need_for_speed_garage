What is NEED FOR SPEED GARAGE?

Need for speed garage consists on a simple project that I created for beginner programmers to get familiar with the basics of version control (in this case through Git), Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation, Test-Driven Development (TDD) using RSpec mocks to mock random behaviour effectively in order to ensure consistent and reliable tests. The technology in which this project is carried out (or Tech Stack) is Ruby.



Developer process:

1) Create a Github repository with a README.md file.
2) Clone the repository in a local directory.
